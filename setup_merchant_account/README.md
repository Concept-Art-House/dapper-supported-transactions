## DEPRECATED 
This section is deprecated. For sales proceed of the storefront use either a merchant account provided by Dapper team or account address of a Dapper Wallet user.

## Setup Merchant Account
To sell from your own Flow account, a dapp should setup DUC (Dapper Utility Coin) auto-forwarder and receiver in their Flow account. The transaction shared here shows how to do that.

After setting up DUC auto-forwarder/receiverm, the dapp should share the merchant account address with the Dapper team to permit-list that address.

All primary sale transaction should either be using such merchant account address or a dapper wallet account address.
