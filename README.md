# Dapper Supported Transactions

This repository contains Flow transaction scripts that the Dapper wallet will support by default. Following these transaction templates will allow for safer and easier integration between dapps and the Dapper Flow wallet. Of course, more transactions will be evaluated and safelisted within the Dapper system as new use cases arise.
